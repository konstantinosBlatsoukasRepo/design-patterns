# Design patterns

 I created this repository in order to get a better understanding of the patterns.
 I believe (is not only my personal belief) that you learn something better when you can explain it.

  Divided in three main categories (as GOF):
  
  1. Behavioural 
  2. Creational
  3. Structural
       
  For each pattern I tried to come up with my own example.
